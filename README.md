# Dodonpachi-Daioujou-Red-Label
Quality of life and cosmetic codes for Daioujou Black Label, as well as an in-progress disassembly

Codename: Red Label

There are a few black label romsets in existence, these codes are made for:

**ddpdojblk (DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label (Japan, 2002.10.07.Black Ver, newer))**

"Black label, newer" is the version of the game where the UI will shake when a boss explodes. The codes and disssembly probably won't apply to any other version of the game. The .xml file is for MAME and the .ini file is for FBNeo. FBNeo is recommended for better audio emulation.

All codes apply to player 1 only.

For Mame: Place ddpdojblk.xml in the 'cheat' folder in Mame's directory

For FBNeo: Place ddpdojblk.ini in support > cheats in FBNeo's directory

## Recommended Codes
### Loop 2 Chain Timer for Loop 1
Make chaining the same as loop 2 even during loop 1.

### Smaller Hitbox
Black label already shrank the player hitbox by a lot, but this code makes it much smaller. Feels like a Ketsui hitbox.

### Aquire Hyper Medals Instantly
When the player fills the hyper meter, they will gain the hyper medal instantly instead of having to pick it up.

### Keep Combo Gauge High While Lasering Large Enemy
Makes it so that the combo gauge is held at a higher value than usual when lasering a large enemy, making it easier to maintain chains. This includes lasering the giant doors in stage 4.

### Shot and Laser Power Level Max
Player no longer needs to pick up power up items and no longer loses power ups on death.

### Increase Combo Gauge Increment Value
Enemies that cannot be multi-hit would be hard to combo from. This makes it easier.
Also forces the increment value to be the same regardless of ship type.

### Longer Hyper I-frames
Increases the invincibility frames the player gets upon activating hyper. 

### Bees Grant Hyper Meter Even During Hyper Mode
Usually bees would only grant hyper meter when not in hyper mode. This allows hyper meter to be gained either way.

### Lives +5 per Score Extend
When achieving a score extend, gain 5 lives instead of 1.

### Stage 4 Extend Gives 5 Lives
Gain 5 lives instead of 1 when grabbing the 1-up from the stage 4 mid-boss.

### Fill Hyper Meter on Death
Hyper meter guaranteed to be filled on death.

### Exy Type B has Type A Movement Speed
Faster Type B.

## Cosmetic

### Change Blue Bullets to Green
Must be activated before selecting ship.

### Change Pink Bullets to Red
Must be activated before selecting ship.

### Red Hyper Colours
Shots and laser in hyper mode will be red.

Must be activated before selecting ship.

### Type B Purple Main Body and Laser Colour
Must be activated before selecting ship.

## Not Recommended Codes
### Lasering Large Enemies Builds Extra Hyper Meter
Overpowered. Values could be changed to make it more balanced.

### Lasering Bosses Builds Extra Hyper Meter
Overpowered. Values could be changed to make it more balanced.

### (Hyper Mode) Gain More Hyper Meter From Enemies
Build more hyper meter when attacking enemies during hyper mode.
Overpowered, especially when using a lvl 5 hyper.

### Max Hyper Rank When Using Hyper
Hyper rank will be maxed out on any hyper activation.

### Hyper Medals Fall Faster and Rise Slower
Basically makes hyper medals easier to be grabbed.
Not recommended, just use the "Aquire Hyper Medals Instantly" code.

### Every Hyper Activation is Level 5
Level 5 hyper activation regardless of the number of hypers in stock.

### Remove Hyper Activation Slowdown
The game has intentional slowdown for about 20 frames when activating hyper. This code removes that. Makes hyper activation feel smoother but it will throw off your muscle memory timings for each stage.
