# Dodonpachi-Daioujou-QoL-Codes-and-Documentation
Quality of life and cosmetic cheat codes for Daioujou Black Label, as well as an in-progress disassembly
There are a few black label romsets in existence, these codes are made for:
ddpdojblk (DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label (Japan, 2002.10.07.Black Ver, newer))
"Black label, newer" is the version of the game where the UI will shake when a boss explodes. The codes and disssembly probably won't apply to any other version of the game
