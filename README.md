# Dodonpachi-Daioujou-QoL-Codes-and-Documentation
Quality of life and cosmetic cheat codes for Daioujou Black Label, as well as an in-progress disassembly

There are a few black label romsets in existence, these codes are made for:

**ddpdojblk (DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label (Japan, 2002.10.07.Black Ver, newer))**

"Black label, newer" is the version of the game where the UI will shake when a boss explodes. The codes and disssembly probably won't apply to any other version of the game. The .xml file is for MAME and the .ini file is for FBNeo. FBNeo is recommended for better audio emulation.

All codes apply to player 1 only.

## Codes
### Loop 2 Chain Timer for Loop 1
Make chaining the same as loop 2 even during loop 1.

### Smaller Hitbox
Black label already shrank the player hitbox by a lot, but this code makes it much smaller. Feels like a Ketsui hitbox.

### Aquire Hyper Medals Instantly
When the player fills the hyper meter, they will gain the hyper medal instantly instead of having to pick it up.

### Keep Combo Gauge High While Lasering Large Enemy
Makes it so that the combo gauge is held at a higher value than usual when lasering a large enemy, making it easier to maintain chains. This includes lasering the giant doors in stage 4.
